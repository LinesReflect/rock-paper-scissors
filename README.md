Rock Paper Scissors

This is a project I built to showcase the JavaScript I have learned from The Odin Project so far.

It works and I am proud of it but there are some places in the code where I feel like something better or more efficient could be done. Maybe when I get better with JavaScript I will come back and clean the code up.
